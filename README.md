#MacWidgets for Java

Mac Widgets for Java is a collection of widgets seen in OS X applications, offered through a Java API. 
These widgets help Java developers create Mac themed applications. 
Their usage is not restricted to Mac though, as they will render across platforms.

#Intent!

This is the initial import, I intend to Mavenize and package the code as well as updating it
to mirror aqua in Yosemite. Updates will be added to this file as they are completed.
